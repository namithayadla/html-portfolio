<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi my name is Namitha and I am currently an incoming senior at the University of North Florida.
  I am currently the President of Club Tennis and it has been a club I have been a part of 
  since freshman year. Other hobbies I enjoy are painting, going on walks and hanging out with 
  friends. I also enjoy drinking coffee and I recently created an instagram to keep a journal of 
  all the coffee shops I've been to.
